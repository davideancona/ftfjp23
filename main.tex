%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography
%% files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include
%% support for advanced citation of software artefact from the
%% biblatex-software package, also separately available on CTAN.
%%
%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing
%% the biblatex styles.
%%

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and
%% references.  The command \citestyle{authoryear} switches to the
%% "author year" style.
%%
%% If you are preparing content for an event
%% sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH, you must use the "author year" style of
%% citations and references.
%% Uncommenting
%% the next command will enable that style.

%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Most mainstream object-oriented languages provide a notion of equality between objects which can be customized to be weaker than
reference equality, and which is coupled with the customizable notion of object hash code.
This feature is so pervasive in object-oriented code that incorrect redefinition or use of equality and hash code
may have a serious impact on software reliability and safety.

Despite redefinition of equality and hash code in mutable classes is unsafe,
many widely used API libraries do that in Java and other similar languages.
When objects of such classes are used as keys in hash tables, programs may exhibit unexpected and unpredictable behavior.
In this paper we propose a runtime verification solution to avoid or at least mitigate this issue.

Our proposal uses \rml, a rewriting-based domain specific language for runtime verification
which is independent from code instrumentation and  the programming language used
to develop the software to be verified.
